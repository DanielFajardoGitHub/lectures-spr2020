In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found yourself searching before. ~~Being an effective practitioner of data science~~ Being efficient in many aspects of life these days is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n",

While web searches still play a role in answering complicated questions, an amazing amount of information can be found through IPython alone.\n",
