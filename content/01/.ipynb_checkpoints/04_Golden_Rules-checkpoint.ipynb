    "### Good Data: Distinct Keys + Variables at Key's Unit-Level = Normalized\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multi-billion dollar firms whose entire business model depends on storing and accessing data. Therefore we should apply our rule and see how they store data:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Long ago, smart people figured out a fundamental principle of database design: that the physical structure of a database should communicate its logical structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "How does that work?\n",
    "1. Every database contains \"elements\" or \"observations\" (rows) and \"variables\" (columns). \n",
    "2. The \"key\" is the variable(s) that identifies a row in the table. \n",
    "    - `GM` is the key for the observation about General Motors in a dataset whose unit is a firm. \n",
    "    - `(GM, 2000)` is the key for the observation for GM in 2000 in a firm-year dataset. \n",
    "    - **Keys should never be missing!** (**Rule 4.A**) If one is, how can you say what that row is?\n",
    "    - **Keys should never be duplicated**. If one is, your database won't have a logical structure any more.    \n",
    "3. Closely related to \"keys\" is the idea of \"units\", refers to the level of aggregation in the dataset. \n",
    "    - Variables in the dataset should apply as properties of the \"unit\" of the \"key\". In other words: **variables are attributes of the key.**\n",
    "    - County population is a property of a county, so it lives in the county database, not the state database. State population is a property of a state, so it cannot live in the county table. \n",
    "    - **Implication: You need one dataset for each unit level. For example:\n",
    "        - One firm-level dataset and one firm-year dataset. \n",
    "        - One county dataset and one state dataset.\n",
    "     \n",
    "If you have distinct keys in your dataset, and all variables apply to the unit of the key, your dataset is said to be _\"normalized\"_. Storing normalized data means your data will be easier to understand and it will be harder to make costly mistakes. (See the example below)\n",
    "\n",
    "I doubt you will ever run a serious regression or analysis on completely normalized data. So at some point you will combine the datasets. Do your best to delay that (**4.B**).\n",

    "I'll simple add that while a \"wet jumpshot\" is good in basketball, \"wet code\" is bad. You've Wasted Everyone's Time by Writing Everything Twice, which is bad even though We Enjoy Typing. Nah, you want your code to be DRY. It's very simple: Don't Repeat Yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few more points:\n",
    "- Don't abstract for the sake of it! Writing functions can be a time-consuming waste of time that eats up time. (Lots of redundancy in that sentence was a waste of time to the reader, but at least it was short. Similarly, bad code is less problematic when it is short.)\n",
    "- **Rule 5.D:** A magic number is a literal number embedded in your code. \"Magic number\" is a pejorative. Having numbers that act as in-line inputs and parameters can lead to errors and make modifying code very tough. For example, in [a simple program](python-files/02a-a-simple-program.html), I wrote `2006` and `['AAPL','MSFT','VZ']` several times throughout the code. This is bad practice!\n",
    "- **Rule 5.D:** If you are going to reuse your code, write a \"unit test\", which is a script that tests out the behavior of the function you've written to make sure it works as intended. It should run your function with a few different inputs, possibly inputs with deliberate errors, test the function's output against _**answer you know in advance are correct**_. Using \"toy\" or \"small\" datasets is essential to developing functions and code more broadly.\n",
    "    - Corollary: Don't unit test for the sake of it. You don't need to check what `round_a_number()` does when you use a string as input. \n",
    "- I don't personally use classes much, if at all. It wasn't necessary or extremely beneficial for my early projects (or so I, uniformed!, thought), so I didn't use them and learn them. Then inertia took over... But defining your own classes can be extremely useful! If you want to use them when warranted during this semester, absolutely go for it.
