    "2. Find the full path to the folder, e.g. `C:\\Users\\Don\\FirstPythonCode`\n",
    "3. In Terminal or Powershell type `jupyter notebook --notebook-dir \"C:\\Users\\Don\\FirstPythonCode\"` \n",
    "    - Here the `--notebook-dir` means that we are opening Jupyter but want to choose the notebook location, and then we type the location.\n",
    "    - I have this command (`jupyter notebook --notebook-dir`) pasted into a note on my computer so I can quickly copy and paste it into the shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice:** \n",
    "- _**Create a folder on your computer called \"FirstPythonCode\"**_ Wherever you want should be fine. \n",
    "- _**Open Jupyter Notebook so that you can see files in that location.**_ You can either navigate within the browser by point-and-click navigation (methods 1-3 above), or use my technique to open Jupyter directly to the location.\n",
