<p><strong>By the end of the semester, your resume, should you choose to, can include your (burgeoning) proficiency with Python, Github, Machine Learning (ML) tools, web scraping, and data viz, in addition to describing your exploits on Github and the final course project.</strong></p>

I'm aiming to make each of those components assessible (e.g. we won't prove any theorems, and I'm boiling down programming to essentials). Still, that menu of skills is not easy to acquire (that's why employers pay \$\$\$ for it!), and...</p>

<li>I swear, youngens these days have it so much easier!</li>
<li><strong>Seriously, getting Python up and running has never been quicker, and we will have some working code soon!</strong></li>
<li>You will be frustrated at times. This is natural! No programmer exists who has not cursed their computer to the depths of hell. <ul>
<li>This is completely true: Half the time, it's a silly typo on line 42 of your code. Like, you literally misspelled "regression" as "regresion".</li>
<li>Corollary: A lot of programming takes place after dark, under the influence of coffee and Red Bull. This is why you misspelled "regresion". Try to program at times when you have a clearer mind :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overcoming those frustrating issues feels soooooo good. You'll feel a sense of accomplishment. Fight for that!</li>
<li>Your classmates are in it too, and they can, and surely will, help.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My half of the bargain:</strong> I will work just as hard as you throughout the semester to improve this new class. It's experimental so some things (lectures, assignments) will succeed and aid you along that journey towards being Terminator 3 Linda Hamilton, and some things I try will fail. When something doesn't work out, I'll try to improve it.</p>
<p><strong>Related: When you have questions in class, ask!</strong> Falling behind is costly, and asking a question is cheap. If you're confused or having computer issues, someone else surely is too. If you're stuck outside of class (homeworks, assignments, etc.), see the resources section of the website for a set of things you can do. After trying the options there, you can always... (come to the drop-in hours!)</p>

<h2 id="Github">Github<a class="anchor-link" href="#Github"> </a></h2><p><em><strong>Note: I use Windows and will be of less help for Mac users. The TA, however, uses Mac and will be more helpful when issues stem from OS differences. GitHub, in particular, might be finicky if you have outdated versions of Safari or any other browser.</strong></em></p>
<p>We will be using <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> a lot in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of your course-related work will go on GitHub.</li>
<li>Discussion / help / announcements will happen on GitHub. (Yes, announcements!)</li>
<li>This entire website is on GitHub!</li>
<li>Assignments are posted on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>But why GitHub? Because it's tremendously effective for developing a project. It is used by <a href="https://github.com/apple">Apple</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uber">Uber</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Netflix">Netflix</a>, Google, Microsoft, Bitcoin, CERN, Chinese censors (wait, what?), and many more large, sophisticated, multi-billion dollar entities.</p>
<p>It's useful for (1) cloud storage, (2) collaboration, and (3) version control.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<h3 id="Register-a-GitHub-account">Register a GitHub account<a class="anchor-link" href="#Register-a-GitHub-account"> </a></h3><p>Your turn: <strong>Register for a free account on <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>.</strong> <em>Give your username <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice">some thought</a>.</em>  (Ideally, it should include your name.)</p>
<h3 id="GitHub-as-cloud-storage-(4-min)">GitHub as cloud storage (4 min)<a class="anchor-link" href="#GitHub-as-cloud-storage-(4-min)"> </a></h3><p>At the very least, GitHub allows for cloud storage, like Google Drive and Dropbox do. There's a bit more structure than just storing files under your account:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repositories (aka "repo")</strong>: All files must be organized into <em>repositories</em>. Think of these as self-contained projects. These can either be <em>public</em> or <em>private</em>.</li>
<li><strong>User Accounts</strong> vs. <strong>Organization Accounts (aka "Org")</strong>: All repositories belong to an account:<ul>
<li>A <em>user account</em> is the account you just made, and typically holds repositories related to your own work. </li>
<li>An <em>Organization</em> account can be owned by multiple people, and typically holds repositories relevant to a group (like STAT 545).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/LeDataSciFi.github.io"><code>LeDataSciFi.github.io</code></a> repo, within its corresponding <code>LeDataSciFi</code> Org. </li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python"><code>awesome-python</code></a> repo is a "curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources" </li>

<h3 id="GitHub-for-collaboration-(4-min)">GitHub for collaboration (4 min)<a class="anchor-link" href="#GitHub-for-collaboration-(4-min)"> </a></h3><p>The "traditional" way to collaborate involves sending files over email. But emails get buried, and, also... who has the most recent version, and what is it?
<img src="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif" alt="You don't want this" width="50%" ></p>
<p>Git(Hub) solves this!</p>
<p>Git (just "Git") is a distributed version control system. Basically: "Imagine if Dropbox and the "Track changes" feature in MS Word had a baby. Git would be that baby." It's great for us because it's optimized for code.</p>
<p>GitHub (not just "Git") is built on top of the Git system. Among the many added features that make collaboration easier, two are worth highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GitHub repository is treated as the "master version".</li>
<li><strong>You can (and probably should!) use <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a> instead of email to track open tasks.</strong> <ul>
<li><em>Issues</em> are a discussion board corresponding to a particular repository. </li>
<li>One "thread" is called an Issue. Some features:</li>
<li>You can tag other GitHub users using <code>@username</code>.</li>
<li>Get email notifications if you are tagged, or are <code>Watch</code>ing a repository.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, check out the Issues in the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2"><code>ggplot2</code></a> repository.</p>
<p>We will talk about collaboration later. Suffice it to say, managing group tasks is of paramount importance in virtually all jobs you might have after college.</p>

<h2 id="***-THE-WORKFLOW-RECIPE--***">*** THE WORKFLOW RECIPE  ***<a class="anchor-link" href="#***-THE-WORKFLOW-RECIPE--***"> </a></h2><p>To start any project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a participation repo on GitHub (you can create a new one, fork or clone an existing one, or for assignments - be invited to one). If it's brand new, make sure to initialize the repo with a README. There is a <a href="https://ledatascifi.github.io/participation/participation.html#setup">gif here showing me opening a new repo</a>.</li>
<li>Clone the repo to your local machine using GitHub desktop. </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="img/clone-to-local.gif" alt="word" title="cloning to local repo"></p>
<p>Now, every time you want to work on the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull the existing master repo into your local repo on your computer (just in case a change was made by others). GitHub Desktop calls this operation a "<strong>fetch</strong>" and Git calls this a "<strong>pull</strong>".</li>
<li>Work on the project in the local repo (on your computer). </li>
<li>"<strong>Stage</strong>" the files to tell Git about those changes. GitHub Desktop automatically sees changes to files in the local repo when you save them and automatically “stages” them, by listing them as “changed” files in the left part of the screen. (Nice!)</li>
<li>"<strong>Commit</strong>" to the changes to tell Git, "yes, I want to do this, and what I did was [describe the changes]". In GitHub Desktop, this means adding a short summary and (optionally) a longer description. Then click the <strong>"Commit to master"</strong> buttom. <strong>Do this early and often!!!</strong></li>
<li>You’re almost ready to push the changes to cloud, but not yet! What if someone else (or you on a different machine) made changes to the master repo? Prevent issues by doing this step: "<strong>fetch</strong>"/"<strong>pull</strong>" from the master repo. (On GitHub Desktop for Windows, you click the "repository" menu and then "Pull".) If there are any conflicts, you’ll be notified and prompted to fix them. If there are conflicts, fix them!</li>
<li>You "<strong>push</strong>" the commited local changes to the master GitHub repo by clicking the <strong>"Push origin"</strong> button! <strong>Do this early and often!!!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even though steps 1 and 5 might seem pointless during solo projects, I encourage you to practice these good habits now, so that when you do collaborative work, you’re protected from mistakes.</p>
<p>Again, commit and push often! It's almost as important as hitting <code>CTRL+S</code> while working on a document.</p>
<p><img src="img/workflow-recipe.gif" alt="word2" title="workflow recipe"></p>
<p>My turn: Demostrate some of the Git version control elements on GitHub</p>
<ul>
<li>Fact: Git only pushes/tracks the <em>changes</em> (called a <em>diff</em>) associated with a commit, so that it doesn't need to take a snapshot of all your files each time. </li>
<li>View commit history of the <a href="https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/LeDataSciFi.github.io">LeDataSciFi.github.io</a> repository by clicking on the "commits" button on the repo home page.</li>
<li>View a recent diff by clicking on the button with the <em>SHA</em> or <em>hash</em> code (something like <code>6c0a5f1</code>).<ul>
<li><strong>This is also useful for collaborators to see exactly what you changed.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>View the repository from a while back with the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> button.</li>
<li>View the history of a file by clicking on the file, then clicking "History".</li>
</ul>
<p>Why version control? In addition to the awful "file naming conundrum" in the comic above,</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't fret removing stuff</li>
<li>Leave a breadcrumb trail for troubleshooting</li>
<li>"Undo" and navigate a previous state</li>
<li>Helps you define your work</li>
</ul>
