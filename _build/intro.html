<p>This is the main landing page for lectures, listing them out. In the future, a smoother UI that makes flipping through these lessons.</p>
<p>Students: As this is the first pass at the class, everything is an experiment. So these notebooks are going to evolve and change throughout the semester quite a bit. Don't assume "Lecture 8" is going to look in April like it does in January!</p>
<p>List the lectures here and link to them...</p>
