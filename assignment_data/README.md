GH allows files of up to 100MB (although it "warns" you above 50MB). However, the limit for assignment repos appears to be 10MB. 

So: I'm trying a work around. The idea is to stash files here, and have you manually download these and place them within your assignment repo. I hope to have a better solution, but this is my best bet on a quick basis.

Sorry,
Don
